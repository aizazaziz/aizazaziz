We evaluated various machine learning models on a house price prediction dataset to find the one that performed the best. This process is crucial for understanding which algorithm is most effective at capturing the complex relationships between a home's features and its price.

Common ML Models for House Price Prediction
A house price prediction task is a regression problem, which means the goal is to predict a continuous numerical value (the price). Here are some of the most common machine learning models used for this task:

1. Linear Models
Linear Regression: This is often the starting point, as it's simple and provides a good baseline. It assumes a linear relationship between the features (like square footage, number of bedrooms) and the target variable (price).

Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet Regression: These are extensions of linear regression that use regularization to prevent overfitting. They're useful when you have a lot of features and want to reduce model complexity.

2. Tree-Based Models
Decision Tree Regressor: This model splits the data based on features to create a tree-like structure, with each leaf node representing a predicted price. They can handle non-linear relationships, but a single tree can be prone to overfitting.

3. Random Forest Regressor: An ensemble model that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions. This approach helps reduce overfitting and generally leads to more accurate and stable results.

4. Gradient Boosting Models: These models, including XGBoost, LightGBM, and Gradient Boosting Regressor, are highly effective. They build trees sequentially, with each new tree correcting the errors of the previous one. They're known for their high performance and are often a top choice in machine learning competitions.


5. Support Vector Machine (SVM) Regressor: This model finds a function that has at most epsilon deviation from the actual target values for all training data. It's effective in high-dimensional spaces.

6. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) Regressor: This non-parametric model predicts the price of a new house based on the average price of its "k" most similar neighbors in the training data.
